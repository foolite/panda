Commercial License
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	This is the appropriate option if you are creating proprietary applications 
	and you are not prepared to distribute and share the source code of your application under the GPLv3.

	if you wish to derive a commercial advantage by not releasing your application under an open source license, 
	you must purchase an appropriate number of commercial licenses from Nuts. By purchasing commercial licenses, 
	you are no longer obligated to publish your source code.

	Commercial licenses:
	* Are on a per developer basis. 
	  Each person who directly or indirectly creates an application or user interface containing Nuts components 
	  is considered a developer.
	* Are perpetual and include upgrades to all minor revisions. 
	  For example: a 2.0 license includes all 2.x releases including 2.0, 2.0.2, 2.1, 2.2.1, etc.
	* Are royalty-free.
	* Remove any obligations to release any source code under GPL.

OEM / Reseller License
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	This is the appropriate option if you are creating a product that is a software development library, 
	toolkit or framework. There are many benefits to partnering with us:

	* With an OEM license, your customers (developers) would not be required to meet the terms of the GPL license and 
	  can use Nuts functionality under your license terms
	* You could offer the only official Nuts-based product in your market
	* Many opportunities for co-branding and co-marketing
	* Get authorized support directly from the Nuts team

	If you think this might apply to you, please contact us directly for details.
